### Welcome to the Gomoku AI  
  
You'll find here a python code running an AI which can play Gomoku against you.  
> Usage: run the python file and call the `jeu()` function.  
> To adjust the AI strength, the parameter to modify is `FEUILLES_MAX` (line 173, increase it for more challenge, set by default to have a maximum response time of 5 secondes).  

Attached to the folder: a report on the algorithm logic (Project_report) and a file explaining the topic and the expectations (Project_subject).  
> Note that all code comments and the files are draft in french (but the code is organized in parts facilitating the logic comprehension).  

Here an image of a final board:

*My AI is quite strong, good luck to all players in their attempts!*
