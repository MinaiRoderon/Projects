### Welcome to the Pulsing Digital Heart  
  
You'll find here a C code running an animation of a digitalized pulsing heart (using GLUT: OpenGL Utility Toolkit).  
> Usage:  
> > To compile: run `gcc digital_heart.c -lGL -lGLU -lglut -lm -o digital_heart`  
> > To start the heart animation: run `./digital_heart`  

> To adjust the animation speed, the parameter to modify is `double time_incr` (line 18, increase it to speed up the animation). By default, the animation should run smoothly on a standard computer.  

*Enjoy*
