### Welcome to Sudoku solver  

You'll find here a python code able to solve a sudoku grid.  
The code logic do NOT use any constraint solver, it has been implemented and sped up manually.  

> Usage: run the python file, then call one of these options:
> > `sudoku(remplissage())` to use the included filling function  
> > `sudoku(sudoku_grid_list)` with `sudoku_grid_list` being a list variable with the numbers read left to right, top to bottom  

Here an image of the filling function usage:  
> `,` separator with or without space in the inputs
